    <pre>Greek mythology is the body of myths originally told by the ancient Greeks,
         and a genre of ancient Greek folklore, today absorbed alongside Roman mythology into 
         the broader designation of classical mythology.
         
         These stories concern the ancient Greek religion's view of the origin
         and nature of the world; the lives and activities of deities, heroes, and mythological
         creatures; and the origins and significance of the ancient Greeks' cult 
         and ritual practices.
         
         Modern scholars study the myths to shed light on the religious and
         political institutions of ancient Greece, and to better understand the nature of 
         myth-making itself.
